                    <p>Hello, I'm Fatma Kara√∂z, 23 years old, from Cappadocia. I am studying computer engineering at Mersin University, my last year. I want to improve myself in the frontend field. I am also interested in game development with unity. My hobbies include playing the drums, learning Norwegian, kneading raw meatballs and fitness. My biggest dream is to get off work and take the stage with my band and travel the world.
